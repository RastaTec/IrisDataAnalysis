# Iris Data Analysis and Visualization

## Description
This project performs data analysis and visualization on the famous Iris dataset. It demonstrates the use of Python libraries such as `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib` to analyze the data and create meaningful visualizations. The Iris dataset contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species of iris flowers.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset is obtained from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris).

## Features
- Load and display the dataset
- Summary statistics of the dataset
- Count of each species
- Pairplot of the dataset
- Correlation matrix heatmap
- Boxplot of the dataset features

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `pandas` library
- `seaborn` library
- `matplotlib` library

## Installation
To install the required libraries, run:
```bash
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib
